# Solving the schdrongier wave equation using finite difference method 
The  time independant schrodinger wave equation is given by 

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{-\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2 \psi}{dx^2} %2BV(x)\psi = E\psi">.
 
 we have used the finite difference method which is a numerical method to solve the above equation in matlab.
